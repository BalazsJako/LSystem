# LSystem
Experimental Lindenmayer System for Geometry Generation

It is a rework of my Lindenmayer System 'LSie' (https://sourceforge.net/projects/lsie/)
Now it comes with a redesigned syntax (see Test4.ls, compare with the other .ls files).
The new syntax supports namespaces, so it is easier to organize symbols.

Working on saving/importing pre-compiled LS units....

Work in progress.
